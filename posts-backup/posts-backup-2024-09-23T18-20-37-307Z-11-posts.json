In bowl of stand mixer, add flour, instant yeast, sugar, salt, baking powder.\r\n2. Mix on low until combined with dough hook until combined.  \r\n3. Warm milk in microwave for about 1 minute or until warm like bath water (around 105F). \r\n4. With mixer running on low, pour in milk, then melted/slightly cooled butter, eggs, vanilla extract.\r\n5. Mix for 30 seconds, then scrape down sides and bottom of bowl to ensure everything is well combined. \r\n6. Turn mixer to medium/low speed, let dough knead about 5 minutes. Let dough sit for few minutes. \r\n7. Meanwhile, whisk together cinnamon, cocoa powder, sugar in bowl, set aside. \r\n8. Add 6 tbsp of butter to a bowl and melt for about 15-20 seconds, then stir so it just looks softened, not fully melted. Set aside. \r\nTransfer dough to floured surface.\r\n9. Roll into 10x12 rectangle about 1/2 inch thick.\r\n10. Brush butter on top, then sprinkle with the cocoa/cinnamon sugar. \r\n11. Using pizza cutter, cut strips about 1 1/4 inch wide, 12 inch long. Roll each strip starting from the top, rolling down to form rolls. \r\nPlace in 9x13 greased pan.  Cover with plastic wrap and place in warm area for 1 hr. (I place mine on a 77F proof mat, or by a sunny window with towel covering it.) Toward the end of the hour, preheat oven to 350F. \r\n12. Once rolls have risen, drizzle heavy cream over rolls & bake 22-28 min.  Let cool & top with buttercream frosting.  Enjoy!",
