Cover bowl with plastic wrap, allow the dough to rise 45-60 minutes in warm area. I rest mine on a 77F proofing mat. \r\n4. Remove plastic, dust surface with flour, carefully take out dough.  Cut dough into 4-5 tbsp sized balls. Roll each to form dough balls. \r\n5. Heat oil 315-330F in Dutch oven or small soup pot, filled about 3 inches height wise. \r\n6.While oil is heating, cut butcher’s twine into 4 strings, 8-9 inch long each, which holds one dough ball.  Lay strings out flat on surface overlapping the one before, pointing strings as clock hands 12&6, 3&9, 4:30&10:30, 7:30&1:30. Place dough ball in middle of strings. Carefully lift strings upward gently, & tie the strings in a single knot, around dough ball as shown in video. Repeat this for every dough ball. Set each aside. \r\n7. Carefully place dough balls 2 at a time in hot oil & fry for few mins on each side until lightly golden brown. Carefully toss donuts in equal parts cinnamon & sugar mixture in small bowl. Lay each on paper towel to drain & cool completely. \r\n8. Make the mascarpone cream by whisking all ingredients w/electric mixer on medium high in a bowl until smooth & fluffy.
