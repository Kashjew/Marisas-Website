Prepare rice. Wash sushi rice rinsing it as many times as it takes until water is not cloudy.  Cook in rice cooker or on stove.\r\n2. In a small bowl, mix salt, rice vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil until the sugar has dissolved. Once the rice is cooked, toss the mixture with the cooked rice in large bowl until combined. \r\n3. Shape & press rice in a 9x9 inch baking square pan. Flatten surface. Cover and cool in fridge for at least 2-3 hours.\r\n4. Once the rice is chilled, cut into bite-sized rectangles. Pat to dry off any excess water condensation.\r\n5. Heat oil in a pan on medium- medium high heat about 1 inch tall in pan, place a few rice pieces carefully in hot oil. Flip each piece after around 30 seconds when side is turning a light golden brown color. Once done cool on cooling rack to drain excess oil.

Prepare chicken filling first. Shred cabbage & finely chop. Add EVOO to a pan and sautee cabbage, garlic, ginger for few minutes until soft.   Set aside. \r\n2. Mix ground chicken in a medium mixing bowl along with egg, chives, soy sauce, salt & pepper to taste, water. Add cabbage mix into bowl and mix with your hand until thoroughly mixed. Set aside.\r\n3. Make the wrappers:  Measure out both flours into separate bowls.  \r\n4. In medium saucepan add the water & salt.  Stir to dissolve. Add the tapioca starch & stir until no lumps.\r\n5. Place the pan over low heat & constantly stir for few mins until 2/3 of the liquid forms into lumps. \r\n6. Immediately remove pan from heat but keep stirring & quickly add the rice flour to the pan.  Stir to combine & transfer starch & flour mixture onto floured lightly floured. \r\n7. Add the EVOO to the dough & knead 5-6 minutes until combined.  While kneading, add a little flour & turmeric to the middle of the dough & fold into itself (while wearing glove to protect hands from turning yellow).  Ad first the dough will be crumbly, but as you continue kneading it, it will come together to be slightly stretchy.\r\n8. If after 5 minutes the dough still seeems crumbly, add 2 ml warm water & continue kneading for another few minutes.  Do not over knead. \r\n9. Cover dough & rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.  \r\n10. After resting, lightly dust floured surface & roll out into a thin, long rectangle.  Dust surface with more rice flour & using pie cutter or knife, cut out 3-4 inch squares.  \r\n11.  Fill each dumpling wrapper with 1-2 tsp of ground chicken filling, then fold gently into desired dumpling wrapper style, sealing wrappers with a few drops of water.\r\n12. In medium Dutch oven or soup pot, heat water or chicken stock over medium heat.  Place dumplings in pot few at a time & cook for few minutes carefully flipping them over.  Dumplings will cook fast.  Serve with hot chili oil, sesame seeds, scallion & Enjoy!",
