      "recipe": "*dutch oven or small soup pot for frying donuts\r\n*butcher’s twine for pumpkin shaping\r\n*cinnamon sticks cut into halves for stems\r\n* 2 tsp dry active yeast\r\n* 6 tbsp warm water 110º F\r\n* 2 tbsp sugar\r\n* 1 ½ c (GF) APF I used Cup4Cup All Purpose Flour\r\n* ⅛ tsp salt\r\n* ⅓ c canned coconut milk\r\n* 1 egg large\r\n* 2 tbsp melted butter\r\n* 1 bottle of canola or vegetable oil\r\n* 1/2 c powdered sugar \r\n* 1/4 c granulated sugar\r\n\r\nCHOCOLATE MASCARPONE CREAM\r\n*1/4 c mascarpone cheese\r\n*2 c heavy cream\r\n*1/3 c powdered sugar\r\n*1-2 tbsp cocoa powder \r\n*cinnamon + sugar for donut coating\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  In small dish, add warm water, yeast, and sugar. Allow yeast to sit 10 minutes until foamy.\r\n2. Add dry ingredients to a bowl and whisk to blend. Pour yeast mixture, eggs, milk, and butter into the bowl.\r\n3. Mix or knead ingredients together to form a soft dough.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap, allow the dough to rise 45-60 minutes in warm area. I rest mine on a 77F proofing mat. \r\n4. Remove plastic, dust surface with flour, carefully take out dough.  Cut dough into 4-5 tbsp sized balls. Roll each to form dough balls. \r\n5. Heat oil 315-330F in Dutch oven or small soup pot, filled about 3 inches height wise. \r\n6. While oil is heating, cut butcher’s twine into 4 strings, 8-9 inch long each, which holds one dough ball.  Lay strings out flat on surface overlapping the one before, pointing strings as clock hands 12&6, 3&9, 4:30&10:30, 7:30&1:30. Place dough ball in middle of strings. Carefully lift strings upward gently, & tie the strings in a single knot, around dough ball as shown in video. Repeat this for every dough ball. Set each aside. \r\n7. Carefully place dough balls 2 at a time in hot oil & fry for few mins on each side until lightly golden brown. Carefully toss donuts in equal parts cinnamon & sugar mixture in small bowl. Lay each on paper towel to drain & cool completely. \r\n8. Make the mascarpone cream by whisking all ingredients w/electric mixer on medium high in a bowl until smooth & fluffy. Put in piping bag or ziplock bag. \r\n9. Once pumpkin donuts are cooled. Using end of a chopstick poke hole in middle of each donut & fill with mascarpone cream. Place cinnamon stick inside for stem. Enjoy! ",
